# 🤝 The DTF Companion  
### Guides and insights for the Data Transformation Framework (DTF)

---

## 📘 Overview  
**The DTF Companion** serves as a practical and narrative-driven collection of guides for users and maintainers of the **Data Transformation Framework (DTF)**.  

It bridges the gap between the code and the craft — explaining how each moving part fits together, why key decisions were made, and how to extend or maintain the system with confidence.

- **Mapping Template Guide** – Managing multi-format CSV mappings using the `_ik+` suffix
