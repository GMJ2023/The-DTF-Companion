# üß© Mapping Template Guide  
### Managing Multiple CSV Mappings in the Data Transformation Framework (DTF)

---

## üìò Overview  
Some agencies may provide more than one file format or header layout ‚Äî for example, weekly vs monthly exports, or data from different branches using the same base name.  
The `_ik+` suffix allows you to support multiple mapping templates **for the same agency** without breaking the Data Transformation Framework (DTF) matching logic or CRM lookups.

---

## üß† Syntax  
Append `_ik+<number>` to the **TemplateName** column in your `mapping-template.csv`.  

| Example        | Meaning                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `AgencyA`      | Default mapping template for this agency |
| `AgencyA_ik+1` | Secondary mapping for the same agency    |
| `AgencyA_ik+2` | Tertiary mapping for the same agency     |

---

## üßæ Important Note  

There is **no requirement** to include agencies that are handled via **PDF processing** in this mapping file.  
The `mapping-template.csv` only applies to agencies submitting **CSV or Excel-based data**.  
Agencies whose data arrives in PDF form are processed separately through the **PDF Parser** component of DTF, which automatically extracts and formats their information using pre-defined parsing logic ‚Äî no mapping rows are needed.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works  

1. During transformation, DTF detects templates such as `AgencyName_ik+1` or `AgencyName_ik+2`.  
2. It uses that variant mapping file **for column transformation only**.  
3. When passing the file to CRM for fuzzy name resolution, the `_ik+<number>` part is automatically **removed**, ensuring clean matching (e.g. `AgencyA_ik+1 ‚Üí AgencyA`).  
4. The `resolveAgencyName_node` logs both values ‚Äî the ‚Äúclean‚Äù name for CRM, and the original variant for internal tracking.

## ‚úÖ Benefits  

- Enables multiple mapping formats per agency  
- Prevents CRM confusion and duplicate account creation  
- Simplifies testing and parallel format transitions  
- Makes log inspection easier (`variantUsed` identifies which map was triggered)
